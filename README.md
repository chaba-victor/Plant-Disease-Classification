# Plant-Disease-Classification

## Dataset description

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset).This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.

Note: This description is given in the dataset itself


# The goal 
To build a model, which can classify between healthy and diseased crop leaves and also if the crop have any disease, predict which disease is it.
