# Plant-Disease-Classification

## Dataset description

This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset) is created using offline augmentation from the original dataset. The original PlantVillage Dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset).This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and infected crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.

NB: This description is given in the dataset itself


# Aim 
Train the ResNet9 model to differentiate healthy from unhealthy leaves and also predict which disease it is that is affecting it. The model should also give suggestions on possible treatment plan for the crop.

[ResNet-9](https://github.com/Moddy2024/ResNet-9) is a deep convolutional neural network trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The architecture is implemented from the paper Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, it's a residual learning network to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper.

          Project in progress ... Deployment in the works.
